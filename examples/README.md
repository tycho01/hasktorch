# Example usage

Basic usage examples:

- *static-tensor-usage* - basic usage of statically typed tensors
- *gradient-descent* - toy gradient descent example
- *multivariate-normal* - example of random sampling from a multivariate
  gaussian distribution.

Experimental prototyping and work-in-progress:

- *ad* - WIP - experimental automatic differentiation implementation
- *bayesian-regression* - WIP - bayesian regression example
- *download-mnist* - download mnist files
- *ff-typed* Experimental implementation of a feedforward network using typed
  tensors based on [Justin Le's
  example](https://blog.jle.im/entry/practical-dependent-types-in-haskell-1.html)
  (forward prop only)
- *ff-untyped* Experimental implementation of a feedforward network using
  untyped tensors based on [Justin Le's
  example](https://blog.jle.im/entry/practical-dependent-types-in-haskell-1.html)
  (forward prop only)
- *playground* - stripped down implementation of untyped tensors for debugging.
