# Untyped MNIST Example

This is a simple MLP implementation of an MNIST classifier using untyped tensors.

This example should be run from the `static-mnist/` directory.

First, run:

`./setup-data.sh` 

This downloads the mnist dataset. Then run:

`stack run mnist-mlp`

The code trains a model then prints some example images to the terminal as ascii art, showing model outputs and ground truth.
