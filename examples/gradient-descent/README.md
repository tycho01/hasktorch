# Toy Gradient Descent Example

This is a toy example using various linear algebra hasktorch functions.

A simple least squares linear regression is implemented.
The implementation is primarily intended for gaining familiarity with basic matrix/vector operations and is not optimized.

For a more complex optimization problem, a backprop-based implementation such as in the lenet example would be preferable.

To run this example, use: `cabal new-run examples:gradient-descent`
