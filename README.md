# Hasktorch 0.2 Pre-Release

Hasktorch is a library for tensors and neural networks in Haskell. It is an independent open source community project which leverages the core C++ libraries shared by PyTorch.

This project is in early development and should only be used by contributing developers. Expect substantial changes to the library API as it evolves. Contributions and PRs are welcome.

Currently we are prepping development and migration for a major 2nd release (please excuse sparsity of docs in the meantime). If you're interested in details or contributing please get in touch (see contributing).

## Project Structure

Basic functionality:

- `deps/` - submodules and downloads for build dependencies - libtorch, mklml, pytorch
- `examples/` - high level example models (xor mlp, typed cnn)
- `hasktorch/` - higher level user-facing library, calls into `ffi/`, used by `examples/`

Internals (for contributing developers):

- `codegen/` - code generation, parses `Declarations.yaml` spec from pytorch and produces `ffi/` contents
- `inline-c/` - submodule to inline-cpp fork used for C++ FFI
- `libtorch-ffi/`- low level FFI bindings to libtorch
- `spec/` - specification files used for `codegen/`


## Getting Started

### on OSX or Ubuntu-like OS's

The following steps run a toy linear regression example, assuming the hasktorch repository has just been cloned.

Starting at the top-level directory of the project, go to the `deps/` (dependencies) directory and run the `get-deps.sh` shell script to retrieve project dependencies with the following commands:

```
pushd deps
./get-deps.sh
popd
```

If you are using CUDA-9, replace `./get-deps.sh` with `./get-deps.sh -a cu92`. Likewise for CUDA-10, replace `./get-deps.sh` with `./get-deps.sh -a cu101`.

These downloads include various pytorch shared libraries. Note `get-deps.sh` only has to be run once when the repo is initially cloned.

Next, set shell environment to reference the shared library locations:


```
source setenv
```

Note `source setenv` should be run from the top-level directory of the repo.

### via nix-shell

```
nix-shell ./hasktorch/shell.nix
```

Will get you into a development environment for hasktorch using the CPU backend.
On NixOS you may also pass in a `cudaVersion` argument of `9` or `10` to provision a CUDA environment:

```
nix-shell ./hasktorch/shell.nix --arg cudaVersion 9 # or 10
```

If you are running cabal or stack to develop hasktorch, there is a shell hook to tell you which `extra-lib-dirs` and `extra-include-dirs` fields to include in your stack.yaml or cabal.project.local. This hook will also explain how to create a cabal.project.freeze file.

### Building examples

Finally, try building and running the linear regression example:

```
stack run regression
```

For additional examples, see the `examples/` directory.


## Using as a library in a project via `nix`

See the example project in `examples/library-example` for a `default.nix` that can be dropped alongside a .cabal file.
